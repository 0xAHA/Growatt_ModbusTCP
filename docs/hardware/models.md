## How Auto-Detection Works

When you add the integration, it attempts to identify your inverter automatically before asking you to choose a profile.

![Auto-Detection Flow](images/auto-detection-flow.svg)

**Key points:**

- VPP-capable inverters (DTC present) are identified with high confidence
- Legacy inverters (no DTC) use model name probing — works for MIN, MIC, SPH families
- If auto-detection picks the wrong profile, delete and re-add the integration with manual selection
- The Universal Register Scanner (Developer Tools → Services) shows the detection reasoning in its output

> **VPP Protocol:** Growatt's Virtual Power Plant Protocol (registers 30000+) enables advanced monitoring and control, and allows automatic model identification via Device Type Code. Models with "VPP + Legacy" fall back to the legacy register range (0–3999) if VPP registers don't respond.

> **Off-Grid Protocol:** SPF inverters use registers 0–97 only. VPP registers are never attempted for these models.

> **Help us test!** If you have an untested model, run the Universal Register Scanner and open an issue with the CSV output.

## Power Flow Notes

### Grid-Tied Models (MIC, MIN TL-X, MID)

No battery and no direct load measurement register. Power flow values are **calculated**:

```text
house_consumption  = solar_total_power - grid_export_power + grid_import_power
self_consumption   = min(solar_total_power, house_consumption)
grid_export_power  = max(0,  power_to_grid)
grid_import_power  = max(0, -power_to_grid)
```

### Hybrid Models (SPH, TL-XH, MOD, WIT)

Both calculated and register-based values are available. Register-based sensors (`power_to_load`, `power_to_user`, `power_to_grid`) are read directly from the inverter and are generally more accurate.

**Battery power sign convention (all models):**

- **Positive** = Battery is charging
- **Negative** = Battery is discharging

> SPF off-grid inverters have hardware that reports the opposite polarity. The integration inverts this automatically — you always see the standard convention regardless of model.

---

## Invert Grid Power

All models support an **Invert Grid Power** option to correct backwards CT clamp installations. When enabled, grid import and export values are swapped, and the sign of all grid power/energy sensors is flipped.

**When to enable:** If the Power Flow card shows export when you are actually importing, or vice versa.

**How to enable:** Integration → **Configure** → toggle **Invert Grid Power**.

## Manual Model Selection Guide

If auto-detection fails (or you want to override), choose based on:

1. **Phase:** Single-phase or three-phase grid connection?
2. **Battery:** Do you have battery storage connected?
3. **PV strings:** How many separate solar array strings are connected?
4. **Power range:** Inverter nameplate rating
